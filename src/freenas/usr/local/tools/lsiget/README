lsiget is a script provided by LSI/Avago/Broadcom for collecting
information on LSI controllers for analysis. It creates a multiple-
megabyte tgz output file in the current directory. Use by copying the
script to a working directory, then extract and run it:

  tar -xvzf lsigetfreebsd_051915.tgz
  cd lsigetfreebsd_051915
  ./lsigetlunix.sh

Type c to continue and the script gathers data. It writes an output file
in the current directory with a name in the form:

  lsi.osname.hostname.mmddyy.HHMMss.tar.gz

Note that this file contains copies of /etc, log files, and other data
that might contain sensitive information.
